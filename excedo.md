				<h2>Background</h2>
			</header>
      <p><i>Backed by Nikkei and the Financial Times, Excedo combines Business English soft skills development, and cross-cultural understanding in an effective & engaging learning solution for global business professionals.</i></p>
			<p>In 2018, I began a consulting project with Excedo to help them to implement and develop effective business cases to scale one on one English language instruction. Eventually I worked with them on a year long project to manage and build their chatbot and messaging capability for their Android and iOS apps.</p>

					<h3>Problem</h3>
				</header>
				<p>The company was looking to implement specific chatbot use cases that would increase user engagement but more importantly operational scalability that included:
        <ul>
	        <li>Customer support</li>
					<li>Learner self help</li>
	        <li>Content creation (CMS)</li>
				</ul></p>

					<h3>Technical Solution</h3>
				</header>
				<p>From my time at Rikai Labs, I had become an expert in the chatbot scripting language <b>Rivescript</b>. Using my expertise in this area, I implemented:
				<ul>
					<li>A passive, more responsive chatbot experience</li>
					<li>A customer support alerting system to identify when learners required assistance</li>
					<li>A content management system that quickly allowed new content to be created and deployed for different personas</li>
				</ul></p>
				<header class="major">
					<h3>Prototyping</h3>
				</header>
				<p>While the scripting language allowed me to mock up prototypes, it still required that I be able to see the chatbot in action in the app. So I worked with Sr DevOps engineers to create a local and cloud based Docker environment that let us prototype for:
				<ul>
					<li>Stakeholder approval</li>
					<li>Internal testing</li>
					<li>Customer test and feedback</li>
				</ul></p>

						<h2>Results</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The results of my efforts were that:
					<ul>
						<li>We could deploy content and messaging for new classes 4X faster</li>
						<li>Docker environment for prototyping UI and UX</li>
						<li>Responsive chatbot that filtered messages and cut down on spam 95%</li>
					</ul></p>
